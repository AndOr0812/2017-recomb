# Sharing datasets in IPFS

IPFS is a content-addressable storage,
meaning that a file will always have the same multihash value (and so,
the same address in the network),
as long as the content is the same.
This can change how databases and archives (like the SRA) are offered and implemented,
since users can collaborate by choosing to share subsets of the archive and spread the network bandwidth.
More importantly,
it avoids the central point of failure,
while still allowing for curation and quality assurance of the data.

A common way of interacting with the SRA is using the SRA Toolkit,
which generates a local cache.
By indexing their local caches and sharing on IPFS,
other users can download data directly from peers,
decreasing the load on the central SRA servers.
If the central repository is not available [GB Editorial Team, 2011][2],
the data can still be found by connecting to peers instead.
SRA submission guidelines can also be updated to require that each submission is available for a period of time on the submitter IPFS node after it is accepted,
to increase redundancy and help seed the content to other users.
